# Randle for Discord

**Randle for Discord** is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot to provide the features of a **text-based virtual tabletop** by supporting dice, cards, and polls for gaming communities. It is open source under the MIT license by Arcanigma Foundation and free to serve for your own community.

The bot is written in strict [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library. It is intended to be served by a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) web dyno, but it can be adapted for other hosting solutions.
